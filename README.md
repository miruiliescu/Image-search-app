# Image-search-app
This app uses html, css and javascript and performs tasks such as image searching, showing images and 
expanding the page if more results are shown. The show more button is visible only when the number
of pages is greater than one.
Also, if you click on the photo's description, it will forward you to the source of the image. I
used unsplash.com for images.
